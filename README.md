# Revly Project

## Start the project

Use `yarn start` to start the project

## Import forward

Some of our local files are re exported.  
To use them  use the following path:

- `kits`: `import {} from 'kits'`
- `contexts`: `import {} from 'contexts'`
- `icons`: `import {} from 'assets/icons'`
- `hooks`: `import {} from 'hooks'`
- `components`: `import {} from 'components'`

## Code formatting

Before every push, run `yarn prettify`
